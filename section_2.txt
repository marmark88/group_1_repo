2. The computational approach the authors use is neural networks to predict 3D coordinates of all heavy atoms for a given protein using the primary amino acid sequence. The network processes inputs through multiple layers of Evoformers and is then followed by the structure module that introduces an explicit 3D structure in the form of a rotation and translation for each residue of the protein. The Evoformer combines data from a related protein sequence and pairwise relationships between amino acids in the protein. The structure module serves as an end-to-end structure prediction that takes the previous output of the Evoformer and then directly predicts the full 3D structure of the protein.
