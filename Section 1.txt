1. Biological problem the authors are trying to solve


The paper focuses on one of the central challenges in molecular biology, which is the long-time protein structure prediction problem: how to computationally predict accurate 3D protein structures from just sequence data. The importance of predicting a protein’s 3D shape with high accuracy is that it would allow us to determine its biological function. Determining structures through experimental methods like X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy can achieve this but these methods are slow and expensive, and not feasible at the scale of entire proteomes. Therefore, the central biological challenge is to reliably infer how a linear chain of amino acids folds into a precise 3D shape governed by physical interactions and evolutionary constraints. The AlphaFold system introduced in this paper uses a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates evolutionary, physical, and geometric information to predict protein structures with atomic accuracy.
