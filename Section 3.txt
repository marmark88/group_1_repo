The AlphaFold paper builds heavily on prior work in three main areas: evolutionary biology, structural bioinformatics, and deep learning techniques in structural biology. Foundational concepts include the use of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to extract evolutionary couplings between residues, drawing on earlier methods such as Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) that showed correlated mutations encode structural proximity. It also relies on decades of protein structure databases, particularly the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which provides the experimental structures used for training and evaluation. From the machine-learning side, the work is deeply influenced by mechanisms and architecture originally developed for natural language processing. Finally, the CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) experiments are a key reference framework, providing standardized benchmarks that shaped both the evaluation methodology and the historical context in which AlphaFold’s advance is measured.
